By using a lawyer who understands the industry and its supply chain, chances of success increase when faced with a challenging commercial situation.I am a dual qualified Solicitor and Chartered Quantity Surveyor at Freeths working in the Construction Team focusing mainly on dispute work. Since leaving school in 1982 I have worked directly in the construction industry up to commencing my training as a solicitor in 2002. During that time I occupied most roles in the industry from site operative through to project manager and this has given me a uniquely detailed in-sight into the industry I now serve as a solicitor. I work with clients from all sectors of the industry and have advised and acted for them in adjudication, court litigation, mediation and arbitrations. My core strength is my overall commercial understanding of the construction industry supply chain including its idiosyncrasies and its commercial diversity. My knowledge of how construction work is accounted for helps me help my clients in achieving commercial outcomes from often challenging situations. Recent experiences include the resolution of a complex termination account, (Circa ¬£11m) along side a claim on a Bond. In these increasingly challenging times, insolvencies are on the increase. A contractor's insolvency leaves a project in distress. How such a project is managed to a conclusion, including securing a party's rights in these often complex legal and commercial circumstances, raises challenges. At Freeths we have a wide experience of getting distressed projects back on their feet. Successfully representing a Tier 1 contractor in a ¬£3m adjudication.

Nu spiller jeg lidt hygge-volley en gang om ugen og er tr√¶ner for min s√∏ns kidsvolleyhold.N√•r jeg skal slappe af, foreg√•r det ofte med en god bog, ved klaveret eller med et strikket√∏j. Jeg bruger ogs√• en del tid i vores have, hvor vi bl.a. hygger os med at spille bold og dyrke vores k√∏kkenhave. Jeg kan lide at lave mad, sylte og bage med h√∏sten - og derefter nyde herlighederne.",2024-09-24 11:35:54

I had always wanted to be a pilot and thought the military was without a doubt the place to get the best pilot training. I spent a over 21 years in the Marines, with the majority of that time as a reservist.  I did spend some of that time in the early 90‚Äôs playing in the sand of Southwest Asia.    Upon leaving active duty I went to work for BC/BS of Massachusetts as a sales representative.  My job was to sell health insurance to small businesses.  The health insurance market in Massachusetts was extremely competitive because of the growth of HMOs in the state, which created a significant change in the marketplace.  It was difficult to sell an 80/20 plan against the rich benefits of an HMO.  Upon my return from Southwest Asia, I took a position with TEXTRON as a Division Service Representative.   This position serviced half of Textron‚Äôs companies and employee‚Äôs welfare plan benefits. I ensured proper administration of the plans by the insurance Companies.  I was then promoted to a Benefit Consultant where I managed all of the welfare benefits and pensions for a number of Textron‚Äôs flag ship companies, Bell Helicopter, Cessna, EZ-Go, and Textron Automotive.  This position provided strategic direction on cost, benefits and carriers to these companies.   In order to continue advancing I needed experience working within an operation, so I took a lateral position as the Compensation and Benefits Manager, for Turbine Engine Components Textron.  In, 2001, Textron sold TECT Power to a private individual and TECT Power was born.  I have had a number of HR leadership roles and was promoted to the Vice President of HR after the sale of TECT to Whitcraft, which I left in 2020.

Because of it I took early retirement and went through the disability sign up procedure, which I would not put my worse enemy through. Now after a year of waiting for disability I finally have an income, small as it is. I was just approved for a liver transplant and was put on the waiting list.

Dr. Balaban holds two PhD titles. In her City and Regional Planning PhD thesis she focused on flood disaster management in Turkish cities, targeting the associated risks for society and planning processes. In her second PhD in Urban Engineering she developed a GIS-based model for spatial distribution of potential urban spaces used as evacuation and temporary shelter sites and piloted this concept in a case study of a district in Istanbul. Her experience is highly relevant when it comes to applying disaster risk prevention concepts in a very practical way on the municipal level.After her Bachelor degree Dr. Balaban continued to work in CRP at METU. From 1999-2005 she was employed as Research and Teaching Assistant. During that period, she was seconded as researcher to the German GeoForschungZentrum (GFZ) in Potsdam, where she dedicated herself to urban flood management in mega cities. Since 2005, with some breaks in between, she is working as part-time instructor and (since 2013) as Assistant Professor in CRP at METU. Main focus of her work is on integrating GIS in planning processes, risk management and mitigation planning, urban flood risk management, GIS-based modelling in mitigation planning. Dr. Balaban is very familiar with all relevant national and international DRM methodologies and concepts. She authored a wealth of publications in relevant fields, e.g. the definition of barriers in the Turkish local context as regards climate change adaptation or lessons learnt for resilience in urban planning derived from an assessment of flood risk factors in riverine cities of Turkey, thus providing her with state-of-the-art knowledge and research experience.Since 2018 she is the responsible project manager for ongoing project called ‚ÄúSpatialization of natural and man-made hazards on UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Turkey‚Äù.
